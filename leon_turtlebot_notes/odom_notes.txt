197 + 95.5 inches traveled in total = 292.5 inches = 7.4295 meters (straight-line distance, assuming no drift.)
 
cartesian distance between start and stop point from odom topic is 7.47
 
So pretty clear that the odom position is in meters.
 
orientation seems to be in radians-- need to check.
no, it doesn't seem to be in radians.
x and y are constant at 0
z initialized as 0
w initialized as 1
z is in (-1, 1)
w is in [0, 1]
 
wherever the robot is initialized, that's the origin position in odom.
From initial pose, x-axis is forwards and backwards
w^2 + z^2 = 1.
 
z is like in a circle-- start at 0; counterclockwise increases until it reaches 0.99999... and then if you keep going, you jump to -0.999.... and then it goes back to 0. turning clockwise goes 0 --> -0.1 --> -0.9999 until you've made the 180 degree turn and then jumps to 0.9999....
