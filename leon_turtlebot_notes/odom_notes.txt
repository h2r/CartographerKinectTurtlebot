geometry_msgs/Pose:
geometry_msgs/Point position
	x, y, z: Coordinates. Units are in meters
geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
	x, y, z, w
Details: 
	When running the amcl_demo (see localization_navigation.txt), robot believes it is at origin of map frame (which is where robot started when map-making process began) with orientation quaternion = (0, 0, 0, 1).
	When turning counterclockwise, z will increase from 0 (initial orientation) to 1 (turned 180 degrees). If Turtlebot continues to turn past 180 degrees, z will jump from 1 to -1 at 180 degrees and then return to 0 as it returns to its original orientation. The w-value of the quaternion will change as z changes as well-- see Invariants section below.
	+x direction is, when at starting point (at origin and orientation quaternion = (0, 0, 0, 1)), is forward.
Invariants:
	Position z-coordinate is always 0 (since Turtlebot moves in the plane)
	Quaternion x, y are always 0
	Quaternion w^2 + z^2 = 1, where w is nonnegative.
