For localization and navigation using the built-in amcl library (see localization_navigation.txt), all messages will be in map_frame.

Localization topics:
/initialpose, /amcl_pose-- both of these seem to have the same information. Message type is geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped. Set location by publishing to /amcl_pose topic. Contains Pose info for current location.

Navigation (goal) topics:
/move_base/goal-- has all the information of the goal but in testing, ran into issues with rostopic echo etc. The latter should generally be fine.
/move_base_simple/goal-- same info as /move_base/goal except this one doesn't track execution status of the goals, just the goals themselves. Message type is /geometry_msgs/PoseStamped. Contains Pose info for goal state.

geometry_msgs/PoseStamped
	std_msgs/Header header-- metadata. see below for more on this.
	geometry_msgs/Pose-- see below for more on this.

geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped
	std_msgs/Header header-- metadata. see below for more on this.
	geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance
		float64[36] covariance-- 6 x 6 covariance matrix
		geometry_msgs Pose-- see below for more on this.

std_msgs/Header
	seq-- integer 1, 2, 3, ... etc. i.e. numbers the messages in order.
	time stamp
	string frame_id-- gives the name of the current frame.

geometry_msgs/Pose:
geometry_msgs/Point position
	x, y, z: Coordinates. Units are in meters
geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
	x, y, z, w
Details: 
	When running the amcl_demo (see localization_navigation.txt), robot believes it is at origin of map frame (which is where robot started when map-making process began) with orientation quaternion = (0, 0, 0, 1).
	When turning counterclockwise, z will increase from 0 (initial orientation) to 1 (turned 180 degrees). If Turtlebot continues to turn past 180 degrees, z will jump from 1 to -1 at 180 degrees and then return to 0 as it returns to its original orientation. The w-value of the quaternion will change as z changes as well-- see Invariants section below.
	+x direction is, when at starting point (at origin and orientation quaternion = (0, 0, 0, 1)), is forward.
Invariants:
	Position z-coordinate is always 0 (since Turtlebot moves in the plane)
	Quaternion x, y are always 0
	Quaternion w^2 + z^2 = 1, where w is nonnegative.
