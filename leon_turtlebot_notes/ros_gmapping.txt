ros_gmapping_121.png made from using gmapping while moving around CIT 121.
ros_gmapping_121_map_saver.pgm made from using gmapping while moving around CIT 121 except to save the map, I used rosrun map_server map_saver -f filename instead of saving the map in Rviz.
ros_gmapping_121_map_saver.yaml has some metadata about the map.
