MAPPING WITH CARTOGRAPHER AND LIDAR

Less verbose form of notes are available down below.

Two options: Use single-echo laser scan or multi-echo laser scan. Not quite sure what that means but you have to pick one. Note that single-echo publishes to the topic /scan and multi-echo publishes to the topic /echoes. There may be other differences as well but I haven't looked too deep into it; I haven't been affected by any of these unknown differences so far so I'll assume they don't exist or don't matter unless that assumption interferes with doing stuff.

Single-echo:
############
cd
source catkin_ws_leon/install_isolated/setup.bash
roscd cartographer_turtlebot
cd configuration_files
# Now for the file turtlebot_urg_lidar_2d.lua, set use_laser_scan to true and use_multi_echo_laser_scan to false.
# Return to the terminal.
roslaunch cartographer_turtlebot turtlebot_urg_lidar_2d.launch
# In a separate terminal:
rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:=192.168.0.10 _publish_multiecho:=false
# This will be the output. Don't worry about the error. That's fine.
# [ INFO] [unix timestamp]: Connected to network device with intensity and ID: H1111009
# [ INFO] [unix timestamp]: Streaming data.
# [ WARN] [unix timestamp]: Could not grab single echo scan.
# [ERROR] [unix timestamp]: Error count exceeded limit, reconnecting.
# [ INFO] [unix timestamp]: Connected to network device with intensity and ID: H1111009
# [ERROR] [unix timestamp]: Tried to advertise a service that is already advertised in this node [/urg_node/set_parameters]
# [ INFO] [unix timestamp]: Streaming data.
# As soon as the first terminal stops giving warn messages about "Queue waiting for data" and starts giving info messages, things are ready to go.

Multi-echo NOTE THAT THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK WITH THE ROSBAG -> YAML + PGM -> LOCALIZATION + NAVIGATION PROCESS, NEED SINGLE-ECHO AT LEAST FOR NOW:
###########
cd
source catkin_ws_leon/install_isolated/setup.bash
roscd cartographer_turtlebot
cd configuration_files
# Now for the file turtlebot_urg_lidar_2d.lua, set use_laser_scan to false and use_multi_echo_laser_scan to true.
# Return to the terminal.
roslaunch cartographer_turtlebot turtlebot_urg_lidar_2d.launch
# In a separate terminal:
rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:=192.168.0.10 _publish_multiecho:=true
# This should be the output.
# [ INFO] [unix timestamp]: Connected to multiecho network device with intensity and ID: H1111009
# [ INFO] [unix timestamp]: Streaming data.
# If you get an output that looks like the output for single-echo (i.e. the info messages don't say "multiecho"), then stop (Ctrl + C) and try again. Usually this shouldn't happen but occasionally it came up while testing. 

Now to visualize map, start up Rviz and do the same as with the camera method below.
To save the map, use 
rosrun map_server map_saver -f map_name
which generates .yaml and .pgm files (no rosbag needed).

Files:
cartographer_lidar_121_stationary.png is a map taken from the lidar while the turtlebot was still.
cartographer_lidar_121.png is a map of cit 121 created using as the turtlebot made a lap around the room. I left some wires around the LIDAR but it still came out alright, with Baxter's table.
cartographer_lidar_121_annotated.png is exactly what it sounds like.
run_one.txt, run_two.txt are the terminal outputs of two successful runs. 

----------------------------------------------------------

Tips for good cartographer results: 
- Drive slowly
- Drive in a straight line as much as possible
- Objects moving quickly are not going to be reflected on map (e.g. person walking at normal speed)
- Pause if desired to let robot perform full calculations (alternatively just save things as a bag and when done, play the bag at a reduced speed).

Commands:

cd
source catkin_ws_leon/install_isolated/setup.bash
roslaunch cartographer_turtlebot turtlebot_urg_lidar_2d.launch
# In a separate terminal:
rosrun urg_node urg_node _ip_address:=192.168.0.10 _publish_multiecho:=false
